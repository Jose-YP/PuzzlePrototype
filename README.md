# PuzzlePrototype
 First project that's meant to be released, original puzzle game

----------------
HOW TO PLAY
----------------
The game is requires to player to organize beads into groups of 3 or more similar colors. After making those groups, the groups can link with other differently typed groups to make chains.

Earth, Sea and Air bead groups can all link together
Light and Dark bead groups can link together

To break chains press the break button to make a breaker bead. If the bead touches any chains then they'll break and make every bead fall to it's lowest position.
If any breaker beads hit a chain immedietly afterm that'll create a combo, multiplying it's chain score.

FEATURES
----------------
MAIN GAME - Play the game for 20 levels, get the highest score in that time frame. 

OPTIONS - It allows the player to mix the audio levels, change the colors of every bead type and remap keyboard controls.

OTHER - The game also shows a local leaderboard of personal records and has a how to play screen to help player get used to the game. It's a new type of puzzle game so I need to ease people into it.

PLANS
----------------
This is intented to be a web release that'll be playable in Itch.io and newgrounds. It'll always be free, and any updates directly to the game will also be free.

WHAT I WON'T DO HERE
----------------
Since this is a first project I'm limiting this to just a single player puzzle game experience. I'm willing to see how far I can go with just that idea but it won't go beyond what the single player puzzle game for the time being

If I were to increase the scope that would have to be a future game.
I would love to do one and I have a lot of ideas for it which includes and aestetic, story and multiplayer mode but that's not this game.
